Displays CLIGEN climate station locations

The main purpose of this application is to allow the user to select a point on the map which can be used to find the closest station. A new set of station parameters also be generated by interpolating parameters from the surrounding stations.
 
To locate the desired point on the map, you can use Zoom Out/Zoom In buttons or scale list control to change the size of map. You can also use the state list selection box to view a state in detail.

The Undo/Redo buttons are designed to allow the map window return to the previous scale.

The Show State Lines, Show County Lines and Show Climate Stations buttons can be used to show these features on the map.

The Refresh button can be used to redraw the map.

To select a location, double-click the left mouse button and a dialog window will pop up to tell you the postion of the chosen point and the climate stations around that point. The chosen point will be denoted as a "+" sign on the map and the surounding climate stations will be highlighted. A circle will be also drawn around the climate station if you select that station in the list box of popup dialog.

After the location is selected you can choose to use the nearest station or generate new data based on data from the surrounding stations. In order to use interpolated data the 'Use Smoothing' checkbox on the main climate window in WEPP must have been checked.  

By clicking on the OK button, the pop-uped dialog will be closed ad the program will return to the main WEPP application, selecting cancel will allow a different location to be selected.
