# This is the configuration file for adding Python scripts to the WEPP Windows interface. The first column
# indicates if the program works with hillslope (H) or watershed (W) files. The second
# column is the name of program that gets displayed on the WEPP main screen. Upto 10 Python programs can be added to the interface.
# The third column is the program to run, normally a Python script to execute. Following that are 0 or more arguments, the values
# inside <> get expanded to file names from the current WEPP project that was run. Any arguments inside
# <> that don't match predefined names are passed to the Python script unchanged. Any text after the # sign on the line is treated as
# a comment that explains how the program works.
# The scripts must be in the WEPP tools subdirectory. Any file names that are passed are relative to the tools subdirectory, such as ../runs
# Any output sent to standard output is redirected to the file output.txt. This file is displayed in the popup Notepad window after the program has finished.
#
# The following is a list of the expansions that can be passed to a Python script:
#    <OUT_WATER_FILE> - The water output file.
#    <IN_SLOPE_FILE> - The slope input file.
#    <OUT_MAIN_FILE>  - Main WEPP output file.
#    <OUT_GRAPHICS_FILE> - Large graphics file
#    <IN_CLI_FILE> - The climate input file
#    <IN_SOIL_FILE> - The soil input file.
#    <IN_MAN_FILE> - The management input file.
#    <IN_RUN_FILE> - Run input options file.
#    <ROOT_DIR> - The install directory for WEPP
